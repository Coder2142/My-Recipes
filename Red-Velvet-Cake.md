 Red Velvet Recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and cocoa powder three 6-inch cake pans. Add 1 cupcake paper to a pan. In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the room temperature butter. Add in sugar and mix on medium until combined. Add eggs in one at a time and beat. Add vanilla extract.
2. In a large bowl, sift the flour, salt and baking soda then whisk together and set aside.
3. Sift the cocoa powder into the butter mixture and cream together. 
4. Add red food coloring and vinegar to the buttermilk then whisk together. 
5. Add ½ of the dry and ½ of the wet to the butter mixture until combined. Add the red buttermilk mixture and beat. Pour the batter into the three prepared pans. Add any extra batter to a cupcake paper. This will be used for the crumble. Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch. Bake the crumble cupcake for about 15-20 minutes. When done, let them cool in their pans for about 5 minutes, and then invert them out onto a wire rack. 
6. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter. Sift confectioners’ sugar into a large bowl. Add room temperature cream cheese to the creamed butter. Add vanilla and a pinch of salt. Beat together. Add the confectioners’ sugar in cups. Mix until combined. If you want a stronger buttercream, keep adding more sifted confectioners’ sugar until you reach a desired consistency. Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag and snip off the tip. 
7. To create the crumbs, you can either break up the cupcake by hand or use a grater. I find that using the grater gives you a more consistent crumb for decorating.
8. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the room temperature butter until smooth. Sift in the confectioner’s sugar. Beat until you get to a desired consistency. Add the rose water. Make sure the buttercream is thick. Dye a few batches yellow, soft pink and pink. Use some matcha powder to create a natural leaf color. Transfer the green buttercream to a bag fitted with a 68 tip. Cut a square of parchment paper. Use a tiny bit of buttercream to glue down the paper onto a piping nail. For the roses, place a small cone of very thick buttercream in the middle of the square. Add bits of yellow in the middle for added dimension. Pipe the petals using a 127 tip.
9. Pipe a thick layer of cream cheese frosting between each layer. Cover the cake in frosting.
10. Use a bench scraper and offset spatula to smooth out the cake. Transfer to the fridge to chill for about 10 minutes or until the frosting is a bit set. If you’re in a warm climate, let your cake chill for even longer!

11. Using your hand, scoop crumbs onto the side and top of the cake until it’s completely covered.
12. Arrange the flowers on top of the cake. Pipe in leaves using the green buttercream.
